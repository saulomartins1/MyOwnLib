This project is a combination of ideas that arose when I decided to incorporate the habit of reading books (e-books) into my routine. When I attempted to read some PDF books using the default browser PDF viewer, I didn't enjoy the user experience and felt that it wasn't optimal. Additionally, I couldn't find any app that exactly matched what I was looking for, so I decided to create it myself.

- <strong>Duolingo:</strong> The goal of Duolingo is that you can progressively learn a language and track your progress. In the MyOwnLib App, the idea is basically the same but with books.
I think it's become easier when you have everything ready to just do what you need to do. (Like learn a language, or read a book).
- <strong>Spotify:</strong> Basically the layout, I like it.
